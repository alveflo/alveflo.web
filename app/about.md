This website primarily serves as a place
for me to write about good-to-know kinda things or just evaluating
cool frameworks or whatever. More importantly writing about some
"gotchas" that I've stumbled upon in order to save myself another
headache, and maybe easing some of your headaches as well.

Oh and my name is Victor Alveflo and I'm swedish software
engineer.
